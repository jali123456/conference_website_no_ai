                The International Conference on Law Enforcement, Legal Systems, and Integrity (ICELIN) is more than just an event; it represents a global commitment to integrity, transparency, and collaboration in justice. Since its inception, ICELIN has provided a platform for leaders, experts, and practitioners to address critical challenges in law enforcement and governance.<br><br>
                ICELIN26 in Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, continues this mission by advancing best practices, fostering professional standards, and strengthening public trust. Our events bring together diverse stakeholders—including academics, policymakers, legal professionals, and NGOs—to inspire innovation and meaningful change.<br><br>
                Through research showcases, panel discussions, and workshops, ICELIN drives practical policy development and lasting partnerships. Our legacy lies not only in the knowledge shared but in the real-world impact that follows.
