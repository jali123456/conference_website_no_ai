                All accepted and presented papers at ICELin 2026 – The 1st International Conference on Enforcement, Law & Integrity will be published in the official ICELin 2026 e-Proceedings, hosted by Elmu University.
                Each paper will undergo a rigorous peer-review and editorial process to ensure academic quality, relevance, and originality across the conference’s core themes, including enforcement, law, integrity, leadership, and disaster resilience.
                The ICELin 2026 Proceedings will be submitted for indexing in Scopus and Web of Science, and archived on academic platforms such as ResearchGate to ensure broad international visibility and long-term accessibility of all scholarly contributions.
                This initiative reflects ICELin’s commitment to advancing impactful research that bridges academia, policy, and practice in building transparent, resilient, and just societies.
