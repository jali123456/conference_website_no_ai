          Enforcement, Leadership and Management University (ELMU) was founded in 2020 by Professor Datuk Dr. Kassim Noor Mohamed and Dato' Hairul Ridza Hayata with its campus operations commencement in 2022 at Bandar Enstek, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Guided by their founding vision and mission, ELMU was built with a commitment to global excellence, innovation, and diversity through education and professional practice in the areas of law enforcement, global security, technology and governance within various sectors of industries.
        </p>
        <p class="text-body-1 mt-3">
          ELMU envisiones being the torchbearer for a new era in education and research, bringing together academia-government-industry in collaboration and engagement that epitomises integrity, inculcates diligence and trustworthiness while forging lasting bonds and being the force of change, together. ELMU aims to contribute value to the future of law enforcement and the domains that it governs by raising the standards in its vast faculties for society, the nation, and beyond.
        </p>
